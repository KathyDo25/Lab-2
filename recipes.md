### Oreo Cheesecake
Crust:
- 24 Oreo cookies, finely crushed
- 1/4 cup (60g) melted butter

Cheesecake Filling:
- 24 oz (680g) cream cheese, softened
- 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
- 1 cup (240ml) sour cream
- 3 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 12 Oreo cookies, chopped

Topping:
- 1 cup (240ml) heavy whipping cream
- 1/4 cup (30g) powdered sugar
- 6-8 Oreo cookies, chopped or crushed

Instructions:
Prepare the Crust:
    Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).
    Mix the finely crushed Oreo cookies with melted butter until well combined.
    Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch (23cm) springform pan.
    Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then set aside to cool.
Make the Cheesecake Filling:
    In a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and granulated sugar until smooth and creamy.
    Add the sour cream, eggs, and vanilla extract. Mix until fully combined and smooth.
    Gently fold in the chopped Oreo cookies.
Bake the Cheesecake:
    Pour the cheesecake filling over the cooled crust in the springform pan.
    Place the springform pan inside a larger baking pan. Fill the larger pan with hot water halfway up the sides of the springform pan (this water bath helps prevent cracking).
    Bake for about 60-70 minutes, or until the center is almost set (it should still have a slight jiggle).
    Turn off the oven, crack the oven door, and let the cheesecake cool in the oven for 1 hour.
    Remove the cheesecake from the oven and the water bath. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.
Prepare the Topping:
    In a medium bowl, whip the heavy cream and powdered sugar until stiff peaks form.
    Spread the whipped cream over the chilled cheesecake.
    Sprinkle chopped or crushed Oreo cookies on top for decoration.
